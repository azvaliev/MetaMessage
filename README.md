This is a [Next.js] TypeScript project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## How It Works

Currently, it uses the [Solana Memo Program](https://spl.solana.com/memo), however it will work through a system of Spl-Tokens in the future.
